# SnapGroup
Gallery, grouping photos by similarity
The project is a mobile application created using React Native. This is a convenient mobile application with two tabs: "Gallery" for viewing photos and "Grouped Photos" for organizing photo albums. Users can easily switch between tabs, thanks to the intuitive interface with icons and color design, which makes navigation simple and intuitive.
